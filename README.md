# WA profile of the 3D CSDM (Cadastral Survey Data Model) JSON schema for data exchange.

This repository defines a profile of the 3D CSDM (Cadastral Survey Data Model) for Western Australia.

_Note that this profile may be further profiled for specific subsets of WA data according to requirements, such as providing certain data in certain circumstances._

The [published form](https://icsm-au.github.io/3d-csdm-profile-wa) includes compiled schemas and semantic annotations drawing on the underlying 3D CSDM model and ICSM profile.  Examples are validated automatically against all these profiles to ensure compatibility.


Profile descriptions showing the underlying model and logical constraints defined by specific and inherited profiles) may be found [here](https://icsm-au.github.io/3d-csdm/docs/wa-profile/)


The [form of these profiles](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/) is based on a common platform for specification development and testing of reusable schemas and profiles (OGC Building Blocks). This supports:

- unambiguous (machine-readable) constraints on use of the underlying [3D CSDM model](https://github.com/icsm-au/3d-csdm) and [implementation schema](https://github.com/icsm-au/3d-csdm-common).
- validation of examples
- test cases
- generation of documentation
- alternative machine-readable forms if required
- automated regression testing (of all examples and test cases) on any changes

The relationships of the ICSM common and jurisdictional profiles and the underlying  common model is shown below:

## Repository Structure (OGC Building Block template)

### Implementable components

The `build/` directory contains the **_compiled specification_** for implementing profiles of the 3DCSM

[profiles/](profiles/) contain vocabulary bindings and content validation rules fpr this profile. Vocabularies themselves are published via the [ICSM Vocabularies repository](https://github.com/icsm-au/icsm-vocabs).

### Editable components

[_sources](_sources) contains the editable components that are composed into the final specification **and must not be directly used**. (This is because critical inherited information is not present in the source materials, and the [automation tooling](https://github.com/opengeospatial/bblocks-postprocess).

This contains:
- `features/`: schemas for the feature types defined by this bb (which is a "super-bb" containing at least oneOf these defined features)
- `datatypes/`: reusable schemas for (potentially complex) datatypes defined by this bb
- `assets/`: Documentation assets (e.g. images) directory. See [Assets](#assets) below.


NB. The common encoding specification is based on component building blocks using the same structure, without the vocabulary and profile specification elements. [More information on design and usage of OGC Building Blocks](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/)
